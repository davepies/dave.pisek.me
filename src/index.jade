    h2 About me

    p Yes, I am a Front End Developer. Passionately. JavaScript, HTML and CSS never cease to excite me.

    p
      | So far I've been lucky enough to work with great people at 
      -var i = 0
      each company in companies
        -if (i === companies.length - 1)
          |  and 
        a(href='http://#{company.name}') #{company.name}
        -if (i < companies.length - 2)
          | , 
         - i++
      |.

        p I enjoy good tools and frameworks. Especially git, vim, zsh, rework, angular, flux / reactjs, mocha, gulp and vagrant.

        p
          | When I am not in front of a screen I like to spend time with my family, read books about really much everything or
          | climb up rocks or indoor-climbing walls. As a born Austrian I eat Schnitzel to keep me going.
